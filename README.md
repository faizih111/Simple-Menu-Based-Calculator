# Simple-Menu-Based-Calculator

A small project that uses **if...else, match, while loops, and for loops**.  
It simulates a text-based calculator with a simple menu system.

## Features
- Displays a menu with operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, exit).  
- Uses `if/else` or `match` to handle choices.  
- Loops until the user exits.  
- Demonstrates iteration with a for loop.
